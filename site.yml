# Ansible playbook to automate the deployment and running of Cloudera's Log4j patch/script on a cluster

#
# Notes:
# - First please read Cloudera's README.md
# - Before running it, set the ansible vars below to match your Env, in particular the script's cmdline
# - For simplicity, I decided to create a single self-contained playbook, instead of a cleaner ansible role (with the vars in the defaults etc)
#   - On demand, I'm happy to refactor this into a role
# - Also: It would have been cleaner & easier to use a different repo/folder for the deployment logic,
#     so we could (recursively) install the files in this repo to the target nodes (w/out ansible files)
